## How it works

Modern pipelined processors suffer from hazards, which are situations where the next instruction cannot execute correctly without stalling, forwarding, or flushing the pipeline. This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) to detect and resolve three classes of hazards:

Control Hazards (Branches)

Triggered when a branch instruction is in the pipeline.

FSM moves to Con (Control Hazard) state.

If the branch is resolved correctly (crct=1), the FSM returns to safe execution (Nor).

If the branch is resolved wrongly (crct=0), the FSM enters Flush for one cycle, asserting do_flush=1 to clear wrong instructions.

Data Hazards (Read-After-Write conflicts)

Detected when data=1.

If forwarding (fwrd=1) is available, the FSM returns immediately to Nor (no stall).

If forwarding is unavailable, FSM transitions to Dat and then to StaN (multi-cycle stall) until the data hazard clears.

Structural Hazards (Resource Conflicts)

Occur when multiple instructions need the same hardware (e.g., ALU + memory).

FSM moves to StaSin (single stall state).

It holds the pipeline for one cycle or until the conflict clears.

The FSM has six states:

Nor → Normal execution, no hazard.

Con → Control hazard handling (waiting on branch).

StaSin → One-cycle stall (structural hazard or speculative branch stall).

Flush → One-cycle flush after mispredict.

Dat → Data hazard detected, forwarding decision pending.

StaN → Multi-cycle stall for unresolved data hazard.

Outputs generated by the FSM:

pc_freeze → Freezes program counter when hazards are active.

do_flush → Signals a flush cycle when a mispredicted branch is detected.

resolved → Indicates hazard-free operation (1 in Nor).

The reset is synchronous, active-low. On reset, FSM returns to Nor (safe state).
